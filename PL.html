    <h1>Premier League</h1>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p>
      This article is about the English association football league. For other
      uses, see <a href="">Premier League (disambiguation).
    </p></a>
    <p>The <b>Premier League </b> (legal name: <b>The Football Association Premier League Limited</b>) is the highest level of the <a href="">English football league system</a>. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of <a href="">promotion and relegation</a>  with the <a href="">English Football League</a>  (EFL).
    </p>
    <p>The competition was founded as the <b>FA Premier League</b> on 20 February 1992 following the decision of <a href="">First Division</a>  (top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. However, teams may still be relegated into and promoted from the <a href="">EFL Championship</a>. The Premier League takes advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to <a href="">Sky:[3]</a> </p>
    <p>The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. <a href="">[8][9]</a> For the <a href="">2018–19 season</a> , the average Premier League match attendance was at 38,181, <a href="">[10]</a> second to the German <a href="">Bundesliga</a>'s 43,500, <a href="">[11]</a> while aggregated attendance across all matches was the highest of any association football league at 14,508,981, <a href="">[12]</a> and most stadium occupancies are near capacity. <a href="">[13]</a> As of 2023, the Premier League is ranked first in the <a href="">UEFA coefficient rankings</a> based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, ahead of Spain's <a href="">La Liga</a>.[14] The English top-flight has produced the <a href="">second-highest number</a> of <a href="">European Cup / UEFA Champions League</a>  titles, with a <a href="">record six</a> English clubs having won fifteen European championships in total.</p>

    <p>This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and <a href="">Second Divisions</a> with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted. <a href="">[27]</a> </p>
    <h2>"Top Four"dominance (2000-10)</h2>
    <p>The 2000s saw the rise of first Liverpool, and then Arsenal to real competitiveness, Chelsea finally breaking the duopoly by winning in 2004-05. The dominance of the so-called <b>"Top Four"</b>  clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United <a href="">[38][39]</a> – saw them finish at the top of the table for the bulk of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the <a href="">UEFA Champions League</a>. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: <a href="">Newcastle United</a> ( <a href="">2001–02</a> and <a href="">2002–03</a>), <a href="">Everton</a>  ( <a href="">2004–05</a>) and Tottenham Hotspur ( <a href="">2009–10</a>) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third</p>
    <h2>Emergence of the "Big Six" (2010s)</h2>
    <p> The years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the "Top Four" with <a href="">Tottenham Hotspur</a> and <a href="">Manchester City</a> both breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the "Top Four" into the <b>"Big Six"</b> . <a href="">[47]</a> In the <a href="">2009–10 season</a>, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break into the top four since <a href="">Everton</a> five years prior. <a href="">[48]</a> Criticism of the gap between an elite group of "super clubs" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs. <a href="">[49]</a> Manchester City won the title in the <a href="">2011–12 season</a>, becoming the first club outside the "Big Four" to win since <a href="">Blackburn Rovers</a> in the <a href="">1994–95 season</a>. That season also saw two of the "Big Four" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season. <a href="">[47]</a></p>
